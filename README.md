# SafeSurf Llama: Your AI-Powered Web Safety Companion

SafeSurf Llama is a browser extension that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to enhance your online safety. It provides real-time analysis of web pages and links, helping you identify potential threats and make informed decisions about your online interactions.

## Features

* **Click-through Inspection:** Analyzes links before you click them, providing insights into the potential safety of the destination website.
* **Customizable System Prompt:** Tailor the AI's behavior with a custom system prompt to focus on specific security concerns.
* **Easy Configuration:** Set your API key, API URL, and model name directly in the extension popup.
* **Intuitive Interface:** A user-friendly interface makes it simple to enable/disable features and manage settings.

## How it Works

SafeSurf Llama integrates with your browser and intercepts link clicks. When you click a link, the extension sends the URL to a configured LLM (e.g., a Llama model). The LLM analyzes the URL and provides a safety assessment based on its knowledge and understanding of potential online threats. This information is then presented to you, allowing you to decide whether to proceed with the click.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Download the extension from the [link to extension store/repository]
2. **Configuration:**
    * Open the extension popup.
    * Enter your API key, API URL, and model name.
    * Optionally, customize the system prompt to fine-tune the AI's analysis.
    * Save your settings.
3. **Activation:** Enable the "Click-through Inspection" option.

## Customization

You can customize the system prompt to guide the LLM's analysis. For example, you might instruct the AI to focus on:

* **Phishing detection:** Identify potential phishing attempts by analyzing URLs and website content.
* **Malware warnings:** Detect links that may lead to malware downloads.
* **Content filtering:** Identify websites with potentially harmful or inappropriate content.

## Security & Privacy

SafeSurf Llama prioritizes your privacy. Your API key and other sensitive information are stored securely within the extension and are not shared with any third parties.
